# 1likte Frontend Developer Test Case

To run the project:
- Please first install the packages (I used "bun", feel free to remove "bun.lockb" and use "npm" or "yarn" or "pnpm" instead)
- Then create a ".env" file based on ".env.example" file
- Then run the project (I used "bun dev")

## Notes

- I used "next-intl" for i18n
- To have i18n on server side too, I used search params and passed current locale to server side. Therefore, created a helper "fetch" function.
- Tried my best on "pixel perfect" design
